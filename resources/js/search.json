You can easily set the created site to be published on GitHub Pagesâ€“ the README file explains how to do that, along with other details.","If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.<a id=\"fnref:1\" href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>1</sup></a> And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.","More specifically, the created site:","uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem","uses the GitHub Pages / Actions workflow to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages","Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.","Browse our documentation to learn more about how to use this theme.","To get started with creating a site, simply:","click \" use this template\" to create a GitHub repository","go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions","If you want to maintain your docs in the docs directory of an existing project repo, see Hosting your docs from an existing project repo in the template README.","It can take up to 10 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-back-ref\">&#8617;</a>"]}],[{"l":"LICENSE","p":["MIT License","Copyright (c) 2022 Sam McNab","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON INFRINGEMENT.
